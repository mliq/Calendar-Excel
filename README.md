# Calendar-Excel

## Introduction
Calendar-Excel is a tool for quickly and easily creating a traditional-style, one month per page, calendar of events in Excel. It is useful for those who wish to create a calendar which can be printed, shared, and updated much faster  than traditional calendaring apps, and without interfering with your normal calendar accounts. 

It was designed for a corporate team managing an annual calendar of many trade show/conferences. It allows one to easily see which days contain multiple events, so as to make the appropriate personnel assignments.

## Technical / Security Note:
Macros must be enabled to update the calendar, but not to view it. 

## Operation:

1.  Enter your event data on the Events tab: Event Name, Starting Date, and Duration (Number of Days). 

2.  Switch to the Calendar tab and click the "Update" button to populate the calendar.

- Any coloring or other font effects you add to the Event Name will be preserved, allowing you to color-code events by any criteria you might find useful.

- The "Hide Rows" button on the Calendar tab allows you to hide months that have passed as the year progresses.
